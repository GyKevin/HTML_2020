<h1>The Shiba Inu</h1>
<h3>Cute Shiba Inu's</h3>
<p>The Shiba Inu is the smallest of the native Japan dog breeds and is the  sole member in the small-sized category.
    <br>
    By far, the Shiba Inu is the most popular of the native breeds due to their looks and size.
    <br>
    With male Shiba Inus reaching only 17 inches and 22 pounds, the Shiba seems to be almost the “perfect-sized” dog.
    <br>
    Not to big. Not to small.
    <br>
    Shiba Inus possess a compact, muscular, and almost perfectly balanced body.
    <br>
    They as all the other native breeds were originally bred as hunting dogs and to this day still possess the hunting instinct.
    <br>
    Shiba Inu coat colors include red, sesame, black and tan, and cream.
    <br>
    The red is the preferred and most popular color while the cream is least desirable.
    <br>
    The Shiba is also the only native dog not named after it’s geographical region.
    <br>
    This was due to the fact that modern day Shiba Inu was bred from a number of Shiba-type dogs in different regions.</p>
